    <p>For the past 8 years this website has served as my own personal sandbox for learning new technologies and maintaining my coding skills. This version is using <a href="https://rsms.me/inter" target="_blank" rel="external">Inter Display</a> for the text, a JSON-file for the content, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a> to display everything on the front-end. The site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Carbon footprint <BlockIcon>🌍</BlockIcon></h3>
    <p>Did you know that the Internet requires a huge amount of electricity, which in turn leads to immense carbon emissions? According to <a href="    https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">websitecarbon.com</a>, the average website produces about 0,5 gram of CO2 per page view.</p>
    
    <p>In order to reduce the carbon emissions, it is important to create fast websites that consumes less of the world’s resources. Normal websites are built each time they are loaded, but using modern technology we can make sure they are only built once 💚.</p>
    
    <p>For this website, I have made sure to keep the design simple and minimize the amount of images and videos. The images are compressed and adapted to the screen resolution. Hosting the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a> means that it is running on sustainable energy. And of course, this site is using a modern Javascript framework (<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a>), which means it is only built when I publish any changes.</p>

    <h2>AI usage 🤖</h2>
    <p>I have not used generative AI for any of the content on this website. This is mostly due to the high energy usage from the Large Language Models (LLMs). Even though some LLMs are running on renewable energy, they still require a lot of resources, which I do not believe is worth it when it comes to dealing with everyday problems. For instance, one single prompt in ChatGPT might require up to 15 times more energy than a Google search*.</p>
